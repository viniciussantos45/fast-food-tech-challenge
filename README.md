## Data Modeling Documentation - Fast-Food System

### 1. model overview

The data model presented represents a system for managing fast-food orders. It includes entities for customers, products, orders, combos and product images.

### 2. entities and relationships

#### 2.1 Customer

- Attributes:
  - id (PK): serial
  - cpf: text (unique)
  - name: text
  - email: text (unique)
- Relationships:
  - One-to-Many with Order

#### 2.2 Product

- Attributes:
  - id (PK): serial
  - name: text
  - category: text
  - price: numeric(65,30)
  - description: text
- Relationships:
  - One-to-Many with ProductImages
  - Many-to-Many with Combo through ComboProducts

#### 2.3 ProductImages

- Relationships:
  - Represents the Many-to-Many relationship between Combo and Product

### 3. Justification for the choice of database

The data model presented is implemented in a relational database, specifically PostgreSQL. This choice is justified by the following factors:

1. **Relational data structure**: The system requires a well-structured data model with clear relationships between entities, which is ideal for relational databases.

2. **Data Integrity**: PostgreSQL offers robust support for primary keys, foreign keys and constraints, ensuring referential integrity and data consistency.

3. **ACID Transactions**: For an ordering system, it is crucial to have support for ACID transactions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability), which PostgreSQL provides.

4. **Scalability**: PostgreSQL is known for its good performance and ability to handle large volumes of data, which is important for an ordering system that can grow over time.

5. **Advanced Features**: PostgreSQL offers advanced features such as indexes, views, stored procedures and triggers, which can be useful for future optimizations and complex business logic.

6. **ORM compatibility**: The use of capitalized table names suggests the use of an ORM (possibly Prisma, given the table name \_prisma_migrations). PostgreSQL has excellent support for several ORM tools.

7. **Open Source and Active Community**: Being open source, PostgreSQL has an active community, extensive documentation and is constantly updated with new features and security improvements.

8. **Flexible Data Types**: PostgreSQL supports a wide variety of data types, including JSON, which can be useful for storing semi-structured data in the future.

### 4. Normalization of the Data Model

The data model was designed following the principles of normalization, reaching up to Third Normal Form (3NF) and possibly Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) in all its tables. This ensures that redundancy and problematic dependencies in the data are minimized.

#### 4.1 First Normal Form (1NF)

All tables are in 1NF because:

- Each column contains atomic (indivisible) values
- There are no repetitive groups
- Each table has a defined primary key

Example: The “Customer” table has a primary key (id) and all its attributes are atomic.

#### 4.2 Second Normal Form (2NF)

The tables are in 2NF because:

- They are in 1NF
- All non-key attributes are totally dependent on the primary key

Example: In the “Product” table, all the attributes (name, category, price, description) are totally dependent on the primary key (id).

#### 4.3 Third Normal Form (3NF)

The tables are in 3NF because:

- They are in 2NF
- There are no transitive dependencies between non-key attributes

Example: In the “Order” table, there are no obvious transitive dependencies between the non-key attributes.

Applying these normal forms to the data model helps to:

1. minimizing data redundancy
2. Ensuring data integrity
3. Facilitating database maintenance and updating
4. Improve the flexibility of the schema for future extensions

This standardized structure provides a solid foundation for the system, enabling efficient and consistent management of data related to fast-food orders.

## GitHub Actions Workflow

### Purpose

The GitHub Actions workflow is designed to automate the process of building and publishing the Docker image for this repository. It ensures that the Docker image is built on every push to any branch and conditionally publishes it to GitHub Container Registry on merges to the `main` branch.

### Triggering the Workflow

The workflow is triggered automatically on every push to any branch. Additionally, it includes a conditional step that publishes the Docker image to GitHub Container Registry when changes are merged into the `main` branch.

### Conditional Publishing

The workflow includes a conditional step that checks if the current branch is `main`. If it is, the Docker image is published to GitHub Container Registry under the repository owner's profile.

## Contributing

Feel free to explore the code and make any necessary modifications to suit your needs.
